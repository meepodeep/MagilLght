## Why does this exist

I have had a problem for a while now when soldering, where I cant hold a light on the thing im trying to work on while im working on it. This makes it difficult to see smaller components and also makes me waste time trying to find a light. This project is made to solve both of these problems by being always wall mounted like a lamp but also able to pinpoint certain spots where I acctually need light and not take up as much space as a lamp. The lock feature also enables me to take better pictures of projects with accurate lighting.
